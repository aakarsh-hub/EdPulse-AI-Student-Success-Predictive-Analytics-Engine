EdPulse AI – Student Success Engine (Predictive Analytics for Educators)

EdPulse AI is an AI-powered student performance intelligence and early-warning system designed for universities, schools, and EdTech platforms. It transforms raw academic data—grades, attendance, and engagement—into predictive insights, at-risk student alerts, topic-level weaknesses, and personalized intervention plans.

The platform enables educators and administrators to move from reactive teaching to proactive student success management.

🚀 Key Capabilities

At-Risk Student Prediction
Identifies students likely to fall behind using grades, attendance, and engagement signals.

Topic-Level Weakness Detection
Surfaces curriculum areas where students consistently struggle.

Personalized Learning Interventions
Generates AI-recommended support plans for each student (practice paths, tutoring focus, revision strategy).

Cohort & Class-Level Insights
Compare performance across:

Sections

Batches

Programs

Courses

Data Upload via CSV
Ingest:

Assignment scores

Quiz results

Attendance logs

Engagement metrics

Explainable AI Risk Drivers
Shows why a student is flagged (e.g., declining attendance + quiz drop).

Reports & Dashboards
Visual summaries for instructors, academic advisors, and leadership.

🧠 Why EdPulse AI Exists

At-risk students are often identified too late

Educators struggle to connect engagement + grades + attendance

Weak topics remain hidden inside spreadsheets

Interventions are often generic instead of personalized

EdPulse AI solves this by creating a real-time student success intelligence layer across academic programs.

Frontend: React + TypeScript

Backend: Node.js API Services

AI Layer: Google Gemini (Predictive + Insight Generation)
